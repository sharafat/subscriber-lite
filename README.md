    Subscriber Lite
</h1>


## About

This repository contains a simple Laravel-Vue.js application built with the purpose of demonstrating many of
Laravel and Vue.js features.

The Subscriber Lite application aims to simplify maintaining the subscribers list of your awesome newsletter.
Along with your subscriber's basic information such as name and email, Subscriber Lite allows you to create custom
fields for collecting more information from your subscribers. You can also specify the type of a custom field
(<i>string, number, date, boolean</i>), as well as indicate if the field is required to be filled-up.

The tech stack used to build this application is:

- PHP 8
- Laravel 9
- MySQL 8
- Vue.js 3
- Tailwind CSS 3
- Alpine.js 3 (only to make the HTML template mobile-responsive)

Feature showcases:

- HTTP JSON API
- Request validation
- Eloquent ORM and model relationships/associations
- Database migration and seeding
- Feature tests
- PSR-2/PSR-12 compliance of source code

<i><b>Note:</b> To keep things really simple and short, authentication and authorization have been avoided.
Also, for the same reason, multi-user scenario has been ignored.</i>
